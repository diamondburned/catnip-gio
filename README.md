GUI frontend in [Gio](https://gioui.org) for the
[catnip](https://github.com/noriah/catnip) visualizer.

## Build

It is recommended that you use the `nix-shell` to obtain the needed
dependencies. Otherwise, refer to Gio's instructions.

After that, build this like a regular Go program:

```sh
go build
```
